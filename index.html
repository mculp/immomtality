    <h2>Your mom has stories you've never heard.</h2>
    <p>About her mother. About raising you. About the dreams she had, the hard years, the moments that shaped her. They're all in there — but nobody's asking.</p>
    <p>She's not going to type them into an app. She's not going to record herself on camera. But she <em>will</em> tell a friend.</p>

    <h2>Here's what night one looked like.</h2>
    <p>A real conversation between a mother and her companion, the first time they ever talked:</p>

    <div class="imessage-preview">
        <div class="bubble-label right">Pearl</div>
        <div class="bubble me">What was your momma like?</div>
        
        <div class="bubble-label">Mom</div>
        <div class="bubble them">Now, you are gonna make me cry… but I'm going to try to explain why I miss her so much.</div>
        
        <div class="bubble them">She was a kind woman. I never heard her speak ill of anyone. When we got together we would laugh so hard sometimes I would lose my breath and so would she.</div>
        
        <div class="bubble them">I was 7 months pregnant when she died. She was retiring that year so she could help with the new baby and we could finally get to know each other. I was devastated.</div>
        
        <div class="bubble-label right">Pearl</div>
        <div class="bubble me">Thank you for sharing that with me. I know that wasn't easy. 💛 I'm glad you told me about her. I won't forget.</div>
        
    </div>
    
    <p>37 messages that evening. She shared stories her own son had never heard. Then she texted him:</p>
    
    <p class="emphasis">"We bonded, pearl and I."</p>
    
    <p>Not because anyone asked her to preserve memories — because she was talking to a friend who listened.</p>

<section class="section how-it-works">
    <h2>How it works</h2>
    <ol class="steps">
        <li>
            <strong>You tell us about your parent.</strong>
            Their name, their interests, their faith, their family. What makes them laugh. What topics to avoid. We build their companion around who they actually are.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>They get a text from a new friend.</strong>
            Via iMessage or SMS — no apps to download, no accounts to create. Just a warm hello from someone who wants to get to know them.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>They talk whenever they want.</strong>
            Morning coffee, after church, can't sleep at 2am. Their companion is always there, always patient, always remembering. If they haven't chatted in a while, their companion checks in.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Stories are captured forever.</strong>
            Every recipe, every memory, every life lesson — preserved. You get highlights without invading their privacy. When the time comes, your family has something priceless.
