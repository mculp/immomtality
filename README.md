# Im*mom*tality

**A friend for your parent. A memory vault for your family.**

Your mom has stories you've never heard — about her mother, about raising you, about the dreams she had. She's not going to type them into an app. But she *will* tell a friend.

Immomtality gives your aging parent an AI companion who texts them on iMessage — no apps, no logins, no learning curve. Just a warm friend who listens, remembers, and never forgets.

## Night One

The first evening a mother met her companion, she shared stories about her own mother that her son had never heard. She cried happy tears. Then she texted her son:

> *"We bonded, pearl and I."*

37 messages that night. Not because anyone asked her to "preserve memories" — because she was talking to a friend.

## How It Works

1. **You tell us about your parent** — their personality, interests, faith, family
2. **They get a text from a new friend** — via iMessage or SMS, zero setup
3. **They talk whenever they want** — morning coffee, after church, 2am
4. **Stories are captured forever** — every memory, recipe, and life lesson preserved

## The Insight

Memory preservation apps ask parents to do work. Companions just... talk. The stories come out naturally, because that's what happens in good conversation. The memory preservation is a *side effect* of friendship.
